            <h3>Lord Of The Rings</h3>
            <p>
                When I was a kid I remember how everything was just amazing.
                The actors, the music, and the effects. 
                Truly magnificent
            </p>
            
            <h3>Anchorman 2</h3>
            <p>
                I watched this movie first before watching the first one
                but I love this movie because it was just too funny. 
                I could not stop laughing and the main character is
                just so good when it's about comedy.
            </p>

            <h3>Rocky movie series</h3>
            <p>
                This was something recent I just watched and I just 
                couldn't believe I did not notice it sooner. 
                Movie is a classic and the main character is legendary
                when it comes to this character. Amazing storyline and 
                all of them were just amazing. The character was
                always interesting.
